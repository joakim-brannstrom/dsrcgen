dsrcgen
=======
The semantic code generation framework for Dlang.

See the unit tests for C and C++ for an idea of how it can be used.

Credit
------
Tomer Filiba for his excellent semantic code generator framework for python.
Without him this framework for Dlang would never have been possible.

Language

At the moment dsrcgen supports:
 * C
 * C++

Any help to add support for new languages are appreciated.
